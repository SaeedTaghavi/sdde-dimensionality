The Jupyter notebook in this directory serves as supplementary information to the
poster I presented at the Delayed Complex Systems conference in Bad Honnef, 2â€“5 July 2018.
It provides details on how I obtained the PCA dimensionality estimates for the nonlinear system.

If you are interested in the underlying code, please see the root of this
repository and the README therein. To see the code exactly as it was for
the poster, checkout the version tagged "bad-honnef-2018".
